<h2 id="access-the-survey-responses"><a href="casper_survey_results.pdf">Access the Survey Responses</a></h2>
<p>Thanks to those who responded to the post-workshop survey. Below I will try to respond to questions and comments raised in the survey. If you would like to read all comments we received, please use the above link.</p>
<h3 id="teaching-materials-were-easy-to-follow-in-terms-of-organization-and-flow">6. Teaching materials were easy to follow in terms of organization and flow</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>I found all of the panel coding for the github to be very confusing and distracted from learning basic R</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: I understand that GitHub can be quite confusing and disorienting for beginners. Still, it remains one of the best systems for organizing and sharing your work. We will be more careful about allotting extra time for git and github learning in the next workshop.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-pace-of-the-workshop-was-appropriate">13. The pace of the workshop was appropriate</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Could have gone a bit faster on 1st day, and there seemed to be a big jump in difficulty from day 1 to day 2</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: Agreed. It’s always challenging to tailor workshop materials and pace to everyone since there is great variation in terms of experience and expertise. I feel that it’s still worth sacrificing pace in favor of helping those who are absolute beginners. Perhaps if the same people attended our next workshop, we may be able to move along faster with more advanced topics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>This was hard. I would have liked to cover more, but in doing so, we would have lost some of the participants, and some of the time I was the one slowing things down. I am not sure that the pace could be faster and keep the workshop as responsive to the need of the participants.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: I agree completely. It’s difficult to go along at a comfortable and fast enough pace for everyone involved. Best to not leave anyone behind.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-anything-would-you-change-about-the-workshop-i.e.-instructor-to-participant-ratio-room-setup-length-of-time-etc.">14. What if anything would you change about the workshop (i.e. instructor to participant ratio, room setup, length of time, etc.)?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Although there is access to content from the workshop, it would be nice to have a guide with all the answers/details following the course as some items are not in the content used during the sessions, which means components I didn’t fully grasp or dont’ remember, I will not be able to duplicate at a later date. Perhaps it might even be nice to have some place to do followup practice with feedback, though I realize this could take a significant amount of time to implement</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: Upon reading this comment, my first thought was to compile a glossary of all the functions/commands we covered during the workshop. Then I realized that I was simply trying to reinvent the wheel. R has a comprehensive documentation system. I think consulting the examples covered in the tutorial and looking at the documentation should clear the matter up. As for items that were covered, but aren’t in the tutorial, this wasn’t my intention. Perhaps if you could point out exactly which ones, I could include them in the tutorial.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>I would take out the github part or try to make the process of using github easier to follow. i.e. not use the panel coding to access github files.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: I think that’s a reasonable request. In fact, there are GUI clients available for accessing GitHub. First, you can access most github up/downloads through R-Studio’s interface (please lookup the help menu). A second, very popular client is <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>. We will look into including these GUI utilities in the workshop so it’s easier to follow than commandline interface.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-other-topics-would-you-like-to-see-in-future-workshops">15. What other topics would you like to see in future workshops?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>More of the same, more examples from other aspects of bio (or even other disciplines)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: Ideally, a dedicated time of 3-4 days would help cover a lot of ground in R. If we come up with a workshop of that length, it would provide extensive opportunities for applying your suggestions. Thank you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Climate statistics over time</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: This is an excellent suggestion. I will be looking for data sets that relate to this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>One thing that would help me would be a short focus on making figures including setting the axis labels, scale, color etc. This was covered a bit, but I could use more. I was given the skills to go find this information on my own though, which is great.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: Absolutely! The only reason I didn’t include extensive plotting functions was lack of time. If you think you could use a one on one session (over zoom) on this topic, I am more than delighted to offer it. Please email me directly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Perhaps another workshop(s) could include topics on how to use various computer tools/programs in giving a presentation and how to have a well organized and better quality presentations. Also, it could be helpful to learn how to find and recognize errors in data collected and/or in research already produced and published. Another interesting topic would be to discuss ethics in scientific research</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: These are all very thought provoking comments - thank you. We will think about including some of these topics in our future workshops. One topic that I am currently working on incorporating into our future workshops is the reproducibility of data analysis, which refers to some of the issues you have raised. In terms of presentations, I am myself slowly moving away from using proprietory software such as Powerpoint and/or Keynote (Mac OS) and instead beginning to make slides that work in browser. As an example, check the R package <a href="https://github.com/yihui/xaringan">Xaringan</a> written by <a href="https://yihui.name">Yihui Xie</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-else-would-you-like-to-tell-us-about-this-workshop">16. What else would you like to tell us about this workshop?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>It would have been great to incorporate our home computers or laptops and set them up prior to the class. If there were problems, we could have gotten them fixed in the first few minutes of the class.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: That would indeed be nice. But my past experience suggests that this is a substantial time sink. That being said, I am happy to help with installation of the software on your personal computers. Please get in touch by email.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>The leaders were very pleasant and made a long workshop enjoyable. However, for someone not well versed in programming, I sometimes felt the pace was a little too quick, so sometimes I missed a key code/step, and was unable to check back for what it was due to the class moving forward. I didn’t really desire to hold back others, so I didn’t say anything at the time, so I claim responsibility for some of this. However, if a guide was included with every step (including the commands), this would have helped things go more smoothly.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: Thank you and I apologize for some of the commands you missed or were confused about. As I mentioned above several time, this really is a balancing act and it’s hard to get the pace just right for everyone. It is with this realization in mind that I prepared the tutorial (at least day 1) to be verbose. Going through the tutorial should help you recap everything we learned on day 1. Please give it a try and if any questions remain, don’t hesitate to get in touch. I also encourage you to not hold yourself back in asking questions. We don’t wish to leave anyone behind, even if we can’t cover all topics as intended.</li>
